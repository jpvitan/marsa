## üìã Quick Guide


### Installation


You can install **MARSA** using pip. Simply run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:


```
pip install
```


### Key Generation


To generate a key pair, import the `rsa` module from the `marsa` package and create an instance of the `KeyPair` class:


```python
from marsa import rsa

key_pair = rsa.KeyPair()
```


### Encryption


To encrypt, create an instance of the `Encryptor` class with the public key from your `KeyPair` object and use the `encrypt()` method:


```python
encryptor = rsa.Encryptor(key_pair.public_key)
secret_message = encryptor.encrypt(message)
```


If you don't have access to the `KeyPair` object, you can manually create a key by using the `Key` class and passing in the required parameters:


```python
public_key = rsa.Key(product, exponent)
```
