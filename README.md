rsa-jpv is a 2048-bit RSA library that operates solely on integers. It has an object-oriented interface that's easy and light to use.


This project was built by Justine Paul Vitan to demonstrate his capabilities in cryptography and number theory. Most algorithms in rsa-jpv are made from the ground up and don't use third-party libraries.


The implementation of rsa-jpv stems from the fundamentals of number theory and does not follow standards imposed for practical use.


## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation


To install the library, open a terminal window and copy the command below.


```
$ pip install rsa-jpv
```
